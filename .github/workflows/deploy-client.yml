name: (disabled) Deploy client via GitHub Pages Actions

# NOTE:
# This workflow previously attempted to deploy using actions/deploy-pages, but
# the repository has been updated to deploy "client/" to the gh-pages branch via
# .github/workflows/deploy-client-ghpages.yml.
# To avoid conflicting deployments and 404s when Pages isn't enabled for Actions,
# this workflow is now manual-only. Use the ghpages workflow for automatic deploys.
